# Duo Calendar

CPSC 581 Project 3 Winter 2020 - Connecting Over a Distance

Created by Katie Tieu and Sam Wong

This is a pair of calendars intended to be used by two people living apart. It serves as a minimalistic way to communicate how you've
been doing even when you don't have time to talk.

# Instructions

To run, clone the repository and open its index.html file path in a browser. For example, file:///C:/Users/katie/Documents/DuoCalendar/index.html

To use:
- Left click a date to set the colour
- Right click to write a note about that day

.

Note that since this is a prototype, it does not have full functionality.
